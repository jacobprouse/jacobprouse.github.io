# Jacob Prouse
This is my portfolio, containing various projects I've been involved in or created myself. I love doing web development, and have fun doing machine learning projects! My various projects reflect this, but because most of my larger work has been done under employment where the technology is private I cannot include it. General descriptions and responsibilities in these projects are noted in my resume, so please navigate there if you wish to know more!
